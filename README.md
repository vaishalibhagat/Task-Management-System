Advanced Task Management System (C++, DSA)

Project Overview
The Multi-Algorithm Task Scheduler is a C++ project that simulates various CPU scheduling techniques to efficiently manage and execute tasks. It allows users to add tasks with specific attributes (priority, execution time, and deadline) and process them using different scheduling algorithms. The system tracks completed tasks and ensures accurate execution time management.

Features
✅ Add tasks with name, priority, execution time, and deadline
✅ Execute tasks using multiple scheduling algorithms:

1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
3. Priority Scheduling
4. Round Robin (with user-defined time quantum)
✅ Track and display completed tasks grouped by scheduling algorithm
✅ Handle invalid inputs to prevent crashes and infinite loops


Technologies Used - 
Language: C++
Data Structures: Queues, Priority Queues, Vectors
Concepts Covered: CPU Scheduling Algorithms, Process Management, Input Validation
